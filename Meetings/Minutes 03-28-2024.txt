Notes Presentation:

Forms should open in the same place as the previous form
less message boxes
show what is commonly used (e.g. schedule) in less clicks
do tabs instead of forms
script demos + video as a backup (but no recorded voice) + don't run code in debug mode (then it wont show Visual Studio)
pathfinding for between tasks/locations
agile work methods
process report
create templates & color paletes => more uniformity
respect the UML structure
dont permanentely delete objects (keep them for historic and reports)
